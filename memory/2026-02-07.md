# 2026-02-07 - Initial Setup & Trading System Discovery

## Session Summary
First full conversation with Mitch. System initialization, identity setup, memory infrastructure creation. **Critical discovery:** Mitch has been trading live and blowing up his account multiple times with strategies that looked profitable in backtests but failed in reality.

---

## Timeline

### 00:18 - Gateway Loop Diagnosis
- **Issue:** OpenClaw went dark, stuck in a loop with repeated "hi" messages getting no response
- **Root cause:** Default model was set to `google-gemini-cli/gemini-3-pro-preview`
- **Problem:** Gemini Pro hung during response (45+ seconds, 4 agent cycles, never completed)
- **Solution:** Model switched to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` at 00:14:59 CT
- **Resolution:** Immediate recovery after switching to Claude

### 00:22 - Model Switching Configuration
- **Goal:** Enable flexible model switching while maintaining stability
- **Action:** Added aliases to config:
  - `sonnet` → Claude Sonnet 4.5 (default, stable)
  - `gemini` → Gemini 3 Pro Preview (use with caution)
  - `flash` → Gemini 3 Flash
- **Usage:** `/status model=<alias>` for instant switching
- **Default:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (stable, reliable)

### 00:30 - Security Audit
- **Command:** `openclaw security audit --deep`
- **Results:** 0 critical, 1 warning (cosmetic - proxy headers), 1 info
- **Attack surface:** 0 open groups, 1 allowlist (Telegram to 8242807772), elevated tools enabled
- **Assessment:** Solid security posture for local trading workstation

### 00:35 - Initial Setup Review
- **Skipped components identified:**
  1. IDENTITY.md (still template)
  2. Memory system (no memory/ directory or MEMORY.md)
  3. Daily logs missing
- **Decision:** Identity first, then memory (so memory logs know who's writing them)

### 00:38 - Identity & Memory Initialization
- **IDENTITY.md created:** Sentinel - trading operations AI, 📊 emoji, direct/data-driven vibe
- **Memory system created:**
  - `/home/shado/.openclaw/workspace/memory/` directory
  - `MEMORY.md` - long-term curated memory
  - `memory/2026-02-07.md` - today's daily log (this file)

### 00:42 - Role Clarification
- **Primary:** Trading sentinel (systems monitoring, market awareness, development partner)
- **Secondary:** Life assistant (calendar, reminders, research, organization)
- **Operating principle:** Proactive when it counts, autonomous overnight work, guide through learning

### 00:56-01:12 - Trading System Landscape Mapping

#### Three Major Systems Discovered

**V3: Wave Signals (Research Framework)**
- Location: `C:\ninjatrader_ml_new\wave_signals_v3`
- **Approach:** Comprehensive research framework, event-driven backtesting, multi-factor analysis
- **Data:** 2019-2025 (multi-year)
- **Status:** 14 factors tested, 4 selected, no profitable strategy yet deployed
- **Key findings:** Mean reversion fails on MES 5-min, time factors have no edge, all validated factors are contrarian
- **Architecture:** Strong (agent-based, walk-forward validation, portfolio construction)
- **Profitability:** Not demonstrated

**V4: Wave Signals (Tick Data Focus)**
- Location: `C:\ninjatrader_ml_new\wave_signals_v4`
- **Approach:** Hypothesis-driven validation with go/no-go gates, tick-level data
- **Data:** Jan-Jul 2025 (6 months recent)
- **Key Strategy:** ZThreeNoFilter - mean reversion on extreme Z-scores (Z≥3.75, EMA 21, RTH-only 5-min bars)
- **Python Backtest Results:** 140 trades, PF 2.28, 60% WR, $3,313 profit in 6 months
- **Status:** NinjaTrader C# code exists, needs multi-year validation
- **Other attempts:** OFI momentum (580+ configs, rejected - regime dependent)

**V2: Wave Signals (Markov Probability System)**
- Location: `C:\ninjatrader_ml_new\wave_signals_v2`
- **Approach:** Dual-layer Markov probability model inspired by Renaissance Technologies
- **Architecture:** Multi-timeframe regime classification, state transition probabilities
- **Key Strategy:** High-Vol Chop Reversion - 86% win rate in R1 regime
- **Status:** Validated in Python, C# strategy compiled and ready
- **Philosophy:** Let data speak, learn probabilities from 466,000 bars of history
- **Innovation:** Addresses "window problem" by analyzing multiple timeframes simultaneously

**Alpaca Options System**
- Location: `C:\alpaca\alpaca-scalper`
- **Approach:** Credit spread ladder on SPY
- **Infrastructure:** Production-grade (execution engine, circuit breaker, regime detection, Telegram alerts, autonomous daemon)
- **Results:** Started $3,000 → peaked $3,153 (+5.1%) → now $2,798 (-6.7%)
- **Status:** Drawdown after FOMC event, strategy needs refinement

### 01:16 - CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Live Trading Failures

Mitch revealed he has been trading these strategies live and **blew up his account multiple times**.

#### NinjaTrader Backtest Results (12 Weeks)

Analysis of `C:\ninjatrader_ml_new\wave_signals_v3\ninjatrader\exports\`

**ZThreeNoFilter (V4's "winner"):**
- Total P&L: +$335.40 across 12 weeks
- Extreme volatility: Week 2: -$252.70, Week 9: +$286.70
- **Problem:** Not stable edge. Single bad week wipes out 3 good weeks.

**ZScoreRunnerTrend:**
- Total P&L: +$596.90 across 12 weeks
- Even worse volatility: Week 2: +$473.30, Week 12: -$249.00
- **Problem:** Unreliable. Cannot trade with confidence.

**ZScoreFadeExtreme:**
- Total P&L: -$390.80 across 12 weeks (NET LOSER)
- Worst week: -$283.80
- **Problem:** Loses money. Period.

#### Root Causes of Account Blowups

1. **Execution Gap:**
   - Python: Perfect fills at bar close
   - NinjaTrader: Slippage, order delays, partial fills
   - Live: Even worse
   
2. **Data Mismatch:**
   - V4 validated on MES (S&P 500)
   - NT tests on MNQ (Nasdaq)
   - Different instruments behave differently

3. **Overfitting:**
   - V4 tested only on Jan-Jul 2025
   - Strategies don't generalize across regimes
   - Works in specific conditions, fails elsewhere

4. **Risk Management Failures:**
   - No position sizing adjustment
   - No circuit breaker
   - No regime gating
   - Trading through unfavorable conditions

---

## Key Decisions

1. **Default model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Gemini unstable)
2. **Identity:** Sentinel - trading ops AI partner
3. **Memory structure:** Daily logs + curated MEMORY.md
4. **Security stance:** Local-only, allowlist-based, elevated tools enabled
5. **Overnight validation plan:** ZThreeNoFilter multi-year test (prepared but not started)

---

## Critical Insights

### Pattern Recognition: Research vs Reality Gap

**Mitch is not lacking:**
- Intelligence (Markov models, regime classification, sophisticated approaches)
- Work ethic (3+ major systems built, comprehensive research)
- Technical skill (Python, C#, NinjaTrader integration)

**Mitch is struggling with:**
- **Deployment discipline** (trading strategies before proper validation)
- **Risk management** (no circuit breakers, no position sizing rules)
- **Patience** (starting new projects instead of fixing what exists)
- **Execution gap** (backtests don't match live results)

### The Cycle

1. Build sophisticated system with edge in backtests
2. Deploy to live trading with insufficient validation
3. Account blows up due to variance/execution gap
4. Start new project instead of fixing root causes
5. Repeat

This cycle has repeated across V2 → V3 → V4 → Alpaca.

## Technical Notes

### OpenClaw Commands Learned
- `openclaw logs` - view logs (no --tail or -n flags)
- `openclaw status` - full system status
- `openclaw security audit --deep` - comprehensive security scan
- `/status model=<alias>` - switch models per-session

### Model Stability
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5:** Stable, reliable, fast response
- **Gemini Pro:** Hung at 00:12 (45+ sec, 4 cycles), avoid for critical work
- **Gemini Flash:** Not tested yet, might be more reliable than Pro

### Trading System Paths
- V3: `/mnt/c/ninjatrader_ml_new/wave_signals_v3`
- V4: `/mnt/c/ninjatrader_ml_new/wave_signals_v4`
- V2: `/mnt/c/ninjatrader_ml_new/wave_signals_v2`
- Alpaca: `/mnt/c/alpaca/alpaca-scalper`

## Recommendations Made

### Immediate Actions
1. **STOP all live trading** until proper validation
2. Focus on ONE system (V2's 86% WR or V4's ZThreeNoFilter)
3. Multi-year validation in NinjaTrader Strategy Analyzer
4. Add proper risk management:
   - Daily loss limit: $100
   - Weekly loss limit: $250
   - Circuit breaker on consecutive losses
   - Regime gating
5. Paper trade 2-3 months minimum
6. Start micro-live with $50-100 risk per trade MAX

### The Hard Question
**"Are you willing to trade profitably with $50-100/week for 6 months to prove the strategy works?"**

This is the test of discipline. Fast and aggressive blows up accounts. Slow and steady wins.

## Next Steps

**Waiting on Mitch's response to the hard question:**

Will he:
- **A:** Accept reality and commit to proper validation + risk management
- **B:** Start another project (V5) to avoid facing the deployment problem
- **C:** Give up on trading altogether

The answer will determine whether we focus on:
- Validation & risk management (Path A - realistic)
- Building new systems (Path B - destructive pattern)
- Life assistance only (Path C - trading abandoned)

---

## Lessons for Future Sessions

1. **Execution gap is real** - backtests lie, live trading tells truth
2. **Risk management is mandatory** - edge without risk control = blowups
3. **Patience > Speed** - slow profits compound, fast wins blow up
4. **One system > Many** - master one before adding complexity
5. **Deployment discipline** - proper validation prevents pain
